# Caesar Cipher
## Irimurielle
## Description
Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z) in both encoded and decoded form. The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A).
